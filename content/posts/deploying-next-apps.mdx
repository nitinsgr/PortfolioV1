<p className=" border-l-4 p-4 text-lg font-serif italic bg-sky-100 border-spacing-2">This project involved a 1-week design sprint focused on improving the search experience for first-time buyers and individuals relocating within the real estate industry. As the sole UX designer, I was responsible for the entire design process, wearing all hats from user research and ideation to prototyping and usability testing.</p>

**Intro / Why?**

Finding your dream home can be an exciting journey, but for many first-time buyers and recent relocators, it can quickly turn into a frustrating maze. Traditional real estate apps often bombard users with irrelevant listings and clunky filters, leading to wasted time and abandoned searches.

In India, buying a home goes beyond bricks and mortar. It's about security, stability, and achieving dreams. However, the fast-paced market can be overwhelming. This section dives into what truly matters to Indian homebuyers: living near family for multi-generational households, seeing real estate as an investment, and considering Vaastu principles for positive energy flow.

**The Daunting Reality**

Statistics paint a clear picture: according to a recent study by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), a whopping 72% of first-time homebuyers reported feeling overwhelmed during their search. This feeling stems from several factors:

- **Uncertain Priorities:** Many first-time buyers struggle to define their ideal property needs and wants. This lack of clarity leads to a scattered search and missed opportunities.
- **Information Overload:** The sheer volume of online listings can be paralyzing. Users get lost in a sea of options, making it difficult to identify properties that truly align with their requirements.
- **Limited Personalization:** Existing search tools often lack the ability to personalize the search experience. This results in irrelevant results and wasted time sifting through listings.

**The Relocator's Burden**

Adding to the challenges, a report by the Employee Relocation Council found that 68% of relocating individuals experience significant stress during the house-hunting process. This stress stems from factors unique to their situation:

- **Unfamiliar Territory:** Relocating to a new city means limited knowledge of neighborhoods, amenities, and local market trends. This lack of familiarity can be a major hurdle.
- **Time Pressure:** Relocating individuals often have a tight deadline to find suitable housing, which can lead to rushed decisions and missed opportunities due to time constraints.

### The Challenge

<img src="/Challenge.jpg"/>

The current real estate search landscape presents a significant challenge for first-time buyers and relocating individuals.

<span className=" font-semibold">*Our design challenge is to develop a user-centered solution that addresses these critical pain points.*</span> This solution should empower first-time buyers and relocating individuals to navigate the real estate search process with confidence and efficiency.

**Understanding User Behavior Through Observation and Reviews**

I started the design sprint by going through Understanding user needs extends beyond demographics. To gain a nuanced understanding of user behavior and their specific needs for the real estate search feature, I employed a two-pronged approach

**Observation:**

- **Observing exisitng solutions:** After reviewing current solutions, I noticed that many of them mirror the same issues we aim to address. This raises questions about how users navigate their decision-making process and the obstacles they encounter within our application.

 </div>
</div>


- **User Review Analysis:** I analyzed user reviews of popular real estate search apps, identifying common themes and frustrations (e.g., irrelevant results, lack of customization, difficulty finding suitable properties). 

<p className=" border-l-4 p-4 text-lg italic bg-sky-50 border-spacing-2">I was able to gain a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and their specific needs within the real estate search process.</p>


Before moving towards **Subject Matter** Interviews and Note taking, I set some *assumptions* about the product, I believe that by testing these assumptions we can identify the gap in understanding of the users and adjust design accordingly.

  <img className=" max-w-4xl" src="/Assumption4.svg" />
 </div>
</div>

Expert interviews will give you a deeper understanding of what stage you currently are in as a company, where do you want to get and who your users are so your team can focus on the most important part, the how.

Finding a subject matter expert on short notice was an adventure!  A few seemed more interested in selling me a house than their expertise (winky emoji). Luckily, I managed to snag a *brief interview* with a real pro who provided some fantastic insights.

**Prior to interview session, I prepared a short welcome script and added some set of open-ended questionnaires.**
 
<img className="" src="/HMW5.svg" />

I spent 15-30 minutes brainstorming and discussing the product's main goals.  **This helped me clarify both what we want to achieve in the short term (our immediate objectives) and what we want to achieve in the next two years (our long-term goals).**

To ensure we stay on track for our long-term vision, we can leverage a concept similar to "How Might We" questions. These are called "Sprint Goals."

  <img className="" src="/Sprint.jpg" />


Sprint Goals help us identify specific challenges that might block us from reaching our two-year vision. By focusing on these roadblocks, we can develop strategies to overcome them and ensure we're constantly moving forward.

We drew the map to help us visualize the flow of the user and have a full picture of how they interact. We split the map into various steps to gain comprehensive understanding on their behavior towards finding a property if they were a first time buyer or user of the application.

### Lightning Demos

I come up with a list of competitors, industry leaders and other companies and highlighted 3-4 features that impressed me guiding me towards design decision.

**Clearly communicate the "why" behind your selection. What makes it interesting or effective?**

<div className="grid grid-cols-2">
<div className="flex flex-cols ">
  <img className="" src="/Hotpads.png" />
</div>
<div className="">
**Why Hotpads considered to be inspirational solution**
- First thing that grabs me is the overall look and feel of the app. It's clean and uncluttered and easy to navigate. Finding the features I need is intuitive, and the icons are clear and recognizable.
- Being able to see available rentals on a map is a huge plus.
- Being able to search for specific keywords like "in-unit laundry" or "balcony" can help you find apartments that meet your exact needs.

<div className="">
**Why trulia is winning the market from so long**
- Trulia shows detailed listing with high-quality photos, virtual tours(Idea inspiration) and detailed description.
- Commute time feature lists out all the listings based on the mentioned commute time.
- Neigborhood Insight, it offers insights into the surrounding area, including schools, crime rates and even noise-level.

**4-Part Sketching**   

I have to admit I might like 4-part sketching even more than the lightning demos. It’s not only an excellent exercises to transform your research into solutions but the reactions you get from your team are priceless. You can expect a lot of ‘It’s impossible to do all that in such a short time frame!’ and ‘there is no way this will work!’ and of course the all time classic ‘I can’t do it, I can’t draw’

During the exercise

- *I took 20 min note taking session,* where I brainstormed few long overdue discussion regarding the problem statement, It is now time to reveal everything.
- Based on your notes start sketching ***very rough ideas of solutions***, just bare bones – don’t worry you won’t be showing them to anyone so you can go crazy but try to make a couple different sketches.

**This crazy pace forces me not to overthink of solutions and helps me jot down solutions.**
  
 <img className="" src="/Crazy.svg" />

 <img className="" src="/K1.svg" />

 It is usually more efficient to do the drawing by hand.

**Art Museum**

By the end of the exercise, I had more than 10+ concept sketches to evaluate from.

<h2 className="bg-black text-white p-6 border-l-4 border-lime-500 font-semibold">Wednesday - Decide & Storyboard</h2>


In the decision-making phase, I weighed the designs' effectiveness, impact, and effort level.

**Since I was working as a solo designer and no to go insane while evluating I had to take respective measures**, I conducted a heatmap analysis. This allowed me to identify which elements in each design were most desirable and usable based on user attention. Additionally, the heatmap data helped assess how well the designs addressed user needs.  I further considered the feasibility of implementing each design based on development resources and its overall viability considering market fit and long-term goals.

**Defining clear criteria helped me objectively evaluate the designs, giving me clarity on the best option to move forward with and the designs that wouldn't meet our needs.**

 <img className="" src="/G30.svg" />

  <img className="" src="/Winning.svg" />


By the conclusion of this exercise, I had developed 3-4 concepts that I believe are not only more compatible but also more user-centric and feasible to implement. **Which I called The Winning Concepts**

**Storyboards**

Storyboards act as a bridge between the whirlwind of ideas and focused creation of prototype. Storyboards helped me foster alignment with the end goal of the user which allows me to depicite the user journey and the key functionalities and user flow.

**Through Storyboard I visualize the user journey from start to end and address any issue by refining and reiterating the concepts this saves a valuable time and resources later in the prototype stage.**

        <img className="" src="/Storyboard.svg" />


<h2 className="bg-black text-white p-6 border-l-4 border-lime-500 font-semibold">Thursday - Prototyping </h2>

During the prototyping session, I prioritized creating paper wireframes that embodied the concepts we'd honed during storyboarding. The beauty of paper prototypes lies in their simplicity and efficiency for user testing. Unlike digital prototypes, they require minimal setup and allow for rapid iteration based on user feedback. This lets us test core functionalities and user flows quickly without getting bogged down in aesthetics.

- Paper prototypes are fast and flexible, unlike digital prototypes, paper requires minimal setup allows for on-the-fly-adjustments.
- Paper prototypes helps us identify the usability issues early on, before getting bogged down in aesthetics.
- Refinements and iterations made easy with rough concepts with valid user feedback.

**It's worth noting that the prototypes I developed might not fall under the strict category of traditional paper prototypes.  They could be considered digital paper prototypes, likely created using a digital tablet and stylus.**

<img className="pt-10 pb-10" src="/Prototyping.jpg"/>


I conducted pilot testing with the paper prototypes, meticulously recording user feedback. This involved noting down improvement suggestions and pinpointing areas where testers encountered confusion. Sticky notes became our allies – we placed them directly on the paper prototypes to mark areas for improvement, and referred back to the storyboard to identify where the user journey needed further refinement.

<img className="pt-10 pb-10 scale-110 max-w-4xl" src="/Pilot.svg"/>

At end of the day, I still had time so I prepared Test Script and Post-task questionnaire for each prototypes.

<h2 className="bg-black text-white p-6 border-l-4 border-lime-500 font-semibold">Friday - Testing</h2>

To conduct a successful usability testing session I decided the main objectives and goals. We wanted to know what we needed to improve in the user experience. To do this effectively, I carefully selected five participants and prepared six tasks for them to complete in two one-hour sessions.

**Task Observation**

**The study involved five participants. Two were people I knew, and the remaining three were recruited through social media advertisements. To accommodate busy schedules and ensure participant comfort, the test was conducted remotely via Google Meet.**

**Paper prototypes facilitated user testing**

<ul class="">
  <li>
    Observe users interacting with your product to *identify pain points, areas of confusion, and natural user flow.*
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask users to verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks, providing insights into their thought process and *decision-making.*
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask users **open-ended questions** about their experience, their impressions of the product's usability, and suggestions for improvement.
  </li>
</ul>

## Conclusion and Retrospective

**Key Achievement**

Although the feature is mere representation of how we can improve the searching experience for the users in real estate industry, 4 out of 5 users had no issue searching through an interactive map-based search experience.

While it was certainly a challenge,  going solo on the design sprint was a valuable learning experience. It fostered my growth as a designer and gave me a newfound appreciation for the collaborative nature of design in general.

**Challenges and Learning**

Based on the obtained results I believe that this is not for us, the search exeprience can be improved in many ways such as integration with (Noise level and crime level data) maybe we can include commute time data gathered through feedback from the users to show the accurate property results to the users.

Educating users prior to showing them the actual feature or functionality should be priority for now. During the testing many users inquired when they stuck mid session which was a negative point for me.

I ensured that the data was collected and utilized responsibly with clear communication and user consent.

**Moving Forward**

- Based on the feedback obtained, I will constantly refine the search filters and experience
- Take some time to explore the concepts that couldn't be tested due to time constraints. Evaluate their potential value to decide if they're worth pursuing.
