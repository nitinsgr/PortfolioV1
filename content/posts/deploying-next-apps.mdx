## Background

{/* Introduction */}
<section>
<div>
 Many first-time buyers and recent relocators face difficulties in searching for their dream house, only to get lost in a labyrinth of irrelevant listings and clunky filters. This is the experience many users encounter with current real estate apps in the market, leading to skyrocketing search time complexities and frustrating mid-session abandonment rates. However, I saw an opportunity to transform the user's journey.
</div>


<div>
  <p className="text-md text-gray-500">Identifying these pain points as major engagement killers, I spearheaded a project to optimize search and reduce search time complexities, <span className="font-bold">reducing their search time by 8%</span>. The improved search experience kept users engaged throughout their journey, leading to a significant drop in mid-session abandonment rates and a 7% increase in average session time. </p>

## Context of the Problem
<hr/>


<p>Resolving the escalating challenge of higher search complexities, which is driving up mid-session abandonment rates within the real estate application.</p>

<p>Let's delve into the problem space, exploring the key factors that contribute to this friction and unveil the underlying reasons why some users find themselves lost in the digital labyrinth of real estate apps.</p>

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-10">
  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Understanding the Knowledge Gap and Information Overload faced by New Users in Real Estate Apps</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700">Unlike experienced buyers, first-timers and relocators lack crucial knowledge of real estate terminology, legalities, and processes. Complex jargon and unfamiliar steps can create confusion and difficulty interpreting listings, filters, and search functions.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">The Human Element: Why Real Estate Apps Can't Replace Personalized Support</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700">Unlike interacting with a real estate agent, apps often lack the personalized guidance and support crucial for first-timers and relocators. Feeling lost without direction can lead to frustration and abandonment, especially for those needing tailored advice based on their unique circumstances.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold">Friction vs. Flow: Building a Seamless User Experience for Real Estate Buyers</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700">Glitches, slow loading times, and broken links can significantly disrupt the user experience, causing frustration and hindering progress. Complex interfaces with unclear navigation or non-intuitive search functionalities can make it difficult for users to find what they need.</p>
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Challenges Faced by New Users When Using Real Estate Apps for Home Buying</h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700">New users added to the complexity by having to navigate an unfamiliar market with different price points, neighborhoods, and community features. Difficulty in understanding these nuances can further increase search complexity and disengagement.</p>

<h2 className="mb-16">Designing and Improving an user experience to increase the average time spent browsing listing by 10% within quater by addressing the top 3 reported technical issues related to search functionality.</h2>

<h2 className=" text-blue-600">Process</h2>
<hr/>

<h2>Setting the stage (Day 0)</h2>

Day 0 invests time upfront to prevent some pitfalls and ensures a smoother, more productive sprint with higher chances of success. It's a crucial step that maximizes the value of the limited sprint time and sets the team up for an impactful journey towards solving the defined challenge.

On day 0, I focused on defining the initial challenge statement. Following this, I dedicated 30 minutes to a solo brainstorming session, which turned out to be invaluable. It provided clarity and a deep understanding of the goals we aimed to achieve by the end of the week.

<h2>Challenge Statement</h2>

<p className=" text-2xl">Real estate app is experiencing concerning increases in user drop-off rates, low user engagement, and increase in Search time. This negatively impacts our ability to attract and retain users, ultimately affecting business growth.
Through a two-week design sprint, we aim to discover the root causes of these issues and develop and test solutions that improve user experience, encourage engagement, and ultimately, foster long-term user retention.</p>

Skipping the afternoon nap, I decided my long term goals and sprint question for the project. Now I've had big plans but they're scary! With self discussion and looking into all the different factors and answering questions I've come to a conclusion.

  <h2 className=" w-2/4">Leveraging Assumptions for Informed Design Decisions</h2>
</div>



Later I spent next 30 min drafting some assumptions about the final product and solution. Think of assumptions as stepping stones across a river. Each stone represents a belief about your users, their needs, and how your solution will impact them. Without these stones, your journey remains confined to the shore, unable to reach the potential waiting on the other side.

Assumptions bridges the gap between our vision and the actual world our user inhabit. Clear assumptions guides decision ensuring that our goal is user centric and aligned. 
> Note :- Do you see those dots on the top of each assumptions, that's how I prioritize which one to focus.

> 2 Research methodlogy used (Desk Research and Primary Research)


<p>The main purpose to conduct the secondary research is to collect the insights that deepen your understanding of the problem space. This data can be qualitative or quantitative and include everything from marketing trends to consumer reports to academic research.</p>

Methodologies -

</div>

<p className="pt-8">These interviews provided the rich human context needed to breathe life into our user journey map. We mapped out their touchpoints with the app, from initial exploration to final decision, capturing their emotions and motivations at each stage.(Shown here...)</p>

Later I turned all the expected key challenges into actional form <span className=" font-bold">HMW Statement</span>. It is more easier to come up with the ideas and solutions for problem space.

<h1 className="mb-4 text-xl font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mt-24 dark:text-white">Define : Formulating Ideas and Solutions from the gathered Insights</h1>

<p>With a solid foundation of concepts, we unleashed our creativity through dynamic ideation exercises. Brainstorming session buzzed the ideas, no matter how outlandish or unconventional they seems.</p>

With a great understanding of the user needs and frustrations, I made some concepts. By exploring various conceptual framework, challenged assumptions, and reframed the problem statement

- <span className="font-bold">Scenario building through notetaking:</span> Imagining different user contexts and how our solution would fit into their lives.
- <span className="font-bold">Crazy 8s:</span> Sketching eight different solution ideas in eight minutes.
- <span className="font-bold">Rapid prototyping:</span> Creating low-fidelity prototypes to quickly test and iterate on ideas.
- 3 step Sketching exercise 

<div className="">
    <img className="" src="/G24.svg" />
    <p className="text-center text-gray-600 mt-2">Crazy'8 and Notetaking</p>
</div>

I evalauted each crazy'8 based on its potential impact, feasbility and alignment with our user insights. Every vote held the weight of possibility, and the room was hummed with focused self-brainstorming session and deep discussion as I self discussed merits of each sketch.

At the conclusion of the activity, I found myself with a pool of 18 excellent ideas to sift through and refine. The next step involved validating and streamlining the search for ideas to be considered further.

At this point, I shared an invitation to participants for the user testing by the end of the 2nd week and prepared set of questionnaire to validate the prototypes.

<h1 className="mb-4 text-xl font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mt-24 dark:text-white">Deciding : Validating Ideas Through Deep Discussion & Voting</h1>

So, I'd been going through a lot of sketching, note taking and gathering information from the past 2 days regarding the project. It's almost time to decide with which solution to move forward and which one to remove from the pool of solution space.

This day :-

- Shifting all the ideas from day 2 (Remote wall) to our art of meuseum, this made it easy to recoganize with which ideas we are planning to move forward with.
- Voting was generally based on Dot voting of evaluation criteria decided by me..
  - Is the solution/Concept Usable for the users?
  - Is the solution/Concept desirable by the users?
  - Is the solution/Concept Feasible to design within the current timeline?
  - What users need they are addressing?
  - Is the product viable?

<img className="" src="/G30.svg" />

It doesn't matter how bad the idea might be, but the main course of action was to explore every possibility and extract valuable insights from each, fostering a culture of innovation and creativity.

I was considering only those ideas which scores above min 5 and max 10 from the concepts, other considerations was the idea should be feasibily achievable and within the given time frame.

<span className=" font-bold">Storyboarding</span>: Storyboards method unifies the entire design sprint on the prototyping the concepts and help take critical decision during the prototype session. A storyboard maps out each step of the experience that you want to test and clarifies the pieces you need to prototype. 

- Drafting scenarios and stories before developing the experience.
- Clearly summarize each solution concept and its key features.
- Sketch it within the minimum steps remember we are solving the problem not trying to invoke it.
- Define the purpose, goal and impact of each concept.

<h3 className="pb-10">I believe that..</h3>
 
- <span className="font-bold">Visualizes Potential Solutions</span>: Storyboards translate ideas and user research into a visual narrative, helping the team see how the solution addresses the problem.
- <span className="font-bold">Focuses on Key User Flows:</span> By selecting specific scenes, you identify the most important interactions for testing, avoiding unnecessary complexity in the prototype.
- <span className="font-bold">Clarifies Design Decisions</span> Storyboarding allows for discussion and refinement of the solution before building, ensuring everyone is aligned on the core concept.

<h1 className="mb-4 text-xl font-extrabold tracking-tight leading-none text-gray-900 md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl mt-24 dark:text-white">Prototype : Rapid Prototyping Session</h1>

I started this session by casually sketching the screens to be designed (With the help of winning storyboard and journey map). Once I had some basic wireframes of the sketches, I moved to digital tool to create interactive prototypes.

<img className=" pb-4 pt-4 max-w-5XL" src="/G39.svg" />

Low-fi wireframes or paper prototyping is a great way to gain early feedback before moving towards designing the final version of the MVP. Through early feedback it allowed me to identify the potential usability issues, risks and if anything need correction.

It is easy to modify the paper prototypes to achieve ultimate success, Primarily focusing on functionality and user flow of the design itself, ensuring core concepts and interaction paths are clear before focusing on visual elements.

<h3 className=" font-semibold text-3xl pt-8 pb-8">Pilot testing </h3>

<p>The pilot group can provide feedback on various aspects of the app, such as its usefulness, design, and overall effectiveness. </p>

<p>The pilot test might reveal limitations in the initial concept itself. Based on usage data and feedback, the developers might discover the app needs additional features or a different approach to address the target audience's needs effectively.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pilot testing helped me try out new ideas and solutions that hadn't been explored before.</li>
            <li>When users get stuck on poorly written tasks, they waste time trying to figure out the interface. Pilot testing allowed me to identify and fix these tasks so users could stay focused on reaching their goals.</li>
            <li>It was easy to estimate the overall time completion for each task, allowing me to prioritize tasks effectively for user testing.</li>
            <li>Collecting data in advance is the best way to gather insight and data before even getting into user testing.</li>
            <li>Fix any issue prior to usability test session</li>

<h3 className="pt-8">Preparation Phase</h3>
<p>I closely worked to define key objectives and goals to conduct a successful usability testing, basically knowing what are we hoping to achieve through this usability testing? What information do we seek? To conduct a successful usability testing I refined and recruited 5 participants and 6 tasks was considered to be ask to perform by the users within 2 hours. (2 Sessions 1hr each)</p>



<h3 className="pt-0">Task Observations</h3>
<ul className="">
<li>
Observe users interacting with your product to identify pain points, areas of confusion, and natural user flow.
</li>
<li>
Ask users to verbalize their thoughts while completing tasks, providing insights into their thought process and decision-making.
</li>
<li>
Ask users open-ended questions about their experience, their impressions of the product's usability, and suggestions for improvement.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>What we have interpreted?</h2>

figuring out what success means by looking at three important measures and thinking about what we personally observed and found.


<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-20">

        <img className="" src="/Table2.svg" />
        <div>
        <p><span className="font-bold">Observation - </span>During usability testing, 22 out of 30 times (73.33%) users successfully completed a specific task. During the confusion participants tried to abandon the task or failed to perform the task</p>
        <p><span className="font-bold">Interpretation - </span>This interprets that most of the user were able to complete the task, but task was either failed or partial success which shows that some usability issues hindering the smooth experience </p>
        </div>

    </div>
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
         <img className="" src="/Table2.svg" />
        <div>
        <p>Based on your user testing, it appears that Tasks 3 and 4 presented significant challenges for participants, as evidenced by high friction and extended completion times. This suggests potential usability issues specific to these tasks that need to be addressed.</p>
        <p><span className="font-bold">Refinements - </span>Based on findings, iteration on design and task 3 and 4. We aim to simplify the task, clarity in instructions and streamlining the task flow to reduce the friction. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Other Observations :

<ul>
<li><span className="font-bold">Heatmap</span> We interpreted that heatmaps provides insight on which areas of the user interface are more attractive and mostly visited by the users during the test.</li>
<li><span className=" font-bold">Observation Points</span> Represents what we expected them to click on this way we interpreted why they lose interest mid-session which leads to abandonment of tasks.</li>
<li><span className="font-bold">Post-task feedback</span>Helps us measure the difficulties and challenges they face, gauges the user sentiments towards ease of use and overall experience</li>
<li><span className="font-bold">Triangulating the data</span>Combining the feedback from qualitative and quantitative sources helps us priortizing the improvement, guide changes and further testing to validate the ef</li>
