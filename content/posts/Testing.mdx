<h2 className="text-[24px]">Turning Point</h2>

A potential client from delhi, impressed by timberstudio's work through a friend's referral, contacted owner for a custom furniture project for their new restaurant. Owner at timberstudio was excited about the opportunity, discovered the limitation of his solely local approach. Distance posed logistical challenges, and without an online presence.They struggled effectively showcase their extensive portfolio and expertise. This experience became a turning point.

<h2 className="pt-4 pb-4">Challenge : A shift towards solution</h2>

Despite of consistent local success, faces limitation in reaching its full potential. Their current focus on a local clientele restricts them from much larger market of potential customers in other areas or city. This limited geographic reach is further compound by the absense of a strong online presence.

As a result,Timberstudio is missing out on a significant number of businesses actively searching for custom furniture solutions online. Additionally, their reliance solely on word-of-mouth marketing hinders their ability to effectively showcase their expertise and the breadth of services they offer.

<h2>Approach to solving the problem</h2>

To ensure the success of timberstudio's platform, I strategically adopted a lean ux approach. This methodology perfectly aligns with my project goals and several key reasons.

Why lean ux though?
<ul className="pl-4 pt-4">
<li>**Focus on outcomes**: The primary objective is to create a product that address user needs and deliver on business goals. Extensive documentation takes a backseat to building and testing solutions that solves a real user problems.</li>
<li>**Rapid Ideation**Lean UX emphasizes a cycle of build-measure-learn. You rapdily creates prototype, gather user-feedback and iterate on the design based on those insights.</li>

<li>**Collaboration and Constant Communication with the cross functional team**: Open communication throughout the project ensures everyone is aligned on the project goals and user needs</li>

<li>**Facts and Validation**: Reducing the guesswork and all the decisions are to be taken on basis of real facts and validated user behavior.</li>

<li>**A MVP of the actual product to test**: Design and development of the MVP(Minimal viable product)</li>
</ul>

<h2 className="pt-8 pb-4 font-bold">Stage 1 - Project Plan and Management</h2>

Following a productive initial client meeting to discuss the project goals, I started working on detailed project plan based on the client brief. This plan would serve as a central communication tool, outlining expectations, deliverables, and a timeline for both our internal team and the client. Ensuring complete transparency throughout the project was a key priority for the client, and this plan would facilitate that.

I believe that planning a project is crucial for opitmizing the resource allocation and it's ultimate success, A well defined plan serves as a roadmap, outlining the key steps, milestones and resources needed to achieve the project goals. Without a plan, projects can easily become derailed by unforseen obstacles, missed deadlines and scope creep.

<h2 className="pt-8 pb-4 font-bold">Re-framing problem</h2>


The initial brief might be ambiguous or lack specific details, Re-framing allows you to clarify the problem statement, define key terms and ensure everyone involved has a clear understanding of the goals and desired outcomes.

An unrefined problem leads to misplaced efforts. You might create a solution that addresses a problem the client thinks exists, but not the one their users actually face. This wastes valuable time, resources and ultimately leaves the user's needs unmet.

By reframing the problem statement, you can approach it from a fresh perspective.

I planned the workshop and divided the overall workshop into phases and stages. These stages helped me work efficiently. I started by defining the initial problem statement or brief that I received from the clients. This brief is overly-focused on the client's needs, requirements and their defination of the problem.

With the help of 4W technique I defined and explored my problem statement underlying issues and definig the key set questions to further refine and understand the problem statement.
