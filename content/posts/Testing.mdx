{  /* About Timberstudio */}
<h2 className="text-[18px] font-medium mt-4">About Client</h2>

Timberstudio is a local startup specialized in custom furniture and wood coatings materials. They cater to a niche market of customers who values unique and personalized furniture pieces.

{ /* Problem Space */}
<h2 className="pb-2 mt-4 font-medium ">First contact</h2>

Client is a close friend of the family who have been into this business from 4-5 years at least, while they have experience running their business, they seem to be recognizing the growing importance of technology and digital presence in the today’s market. 
Given our personal relationship, I want to ensure we approach this project professionally. I’m happy to discuss their needs and explore how I might be a good fit for the project. However, I also want to be transparent about potential conflicts of interest and suggest alternative solutions if necessary.

{  /* Objectives */}

<h2 className="text-[18px] font-medium mt-4">Project Scope and brief</h2>

This project entails the design development and launch of a brand-new website that will serve as Timber studio’s digital storefront. The website will be a comprehensive online hub showcasing your exquisite custom furniture creations, wood coating materials and the expertise behind your brand. It will serve as a platform to connect with potential customers, educate them about your offerings and ultimately convert interest into sales.


{  /* Process */}


<h2 className="text-[18px] font-medium mt-4">Setting Stage and Kicking Off things</h2>

Prior to designing anything it is better to understand for whom we are designing it for, I scheduled a kick-off meeting with the clients to understand thier needs/wants, how do they work in the business, Who is responsible for taking the crucial decision.

{/* *Tools* : During the project I've used Miro to general brainstoming and rough notetaking purposes, Google drive for accessing and storing documents for quick access. Word for content writing.

The process priortizes user research to understand why behind the certain purchase intent and behavior from the customer.

- **Discover context of the problem**: During the first initial phase of the project, I spend a good amount of time understanding the problem space and spcifying the context of use (How user would interact with the product).

- **Translate Insights**: I synthesized gathered data to translate them into insights which specifies the core user requirements, frustrations and friction points while they are interacting with the product.

- **Potential Ideas/Soltion building**: Next, I brainstormed and created potential answers to the problems that have been identified earlier in the process. I kept the user forefront of my mind throughout the process. The goal was to generate as many ideas as possible, Wild thinking and challenged assumptions to spark innovative ideas and solutions.

- **Go/No-Go Decisions**: Through testing and evaluation, I was able to make informed decision about which solution, if any, would move forward. This involved presenting refined solutions to stakeholders for final approval or potentially going back to the drawing the board if significant issue identified. */}

An effective project timeline and requirements were decided through a comprehensive activity which allowed me to align the business goals and their individual goal.

<h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium mt-4">Finding trends in data</h2>

Having gained valuable insights from the initial brainstorming session, I transitioned to the next phase: desk research. Here, I delved into a vast network of information – existing literature, industry reports, and learnings from big industry holders – all related to [topic of research].

Desk research yielded positive results, validating many of the initial assumptions we formulated during brainstorming.

<h2 className="text-[20px] font-medium mt-4">Gathering Insights</h2>

I set out with a standard communication plan, early discussion revealed that some stakeholders struggling to grasp the user-centered approach and reasoning behind our UX recommendations. It became clear that I had to maintain my sails.

I conducted a quick telephonic interview with both the stakeholders of the Timberstudio to understand 
- What are the business goals they want to achieve through this project?
- What are the potential Pitfalls?
- What	do they want to accomplish?
- What actions they want their users to take?
- What problems do they want to solve?
- Who are their primary users? Whom they want to retain on their website?
